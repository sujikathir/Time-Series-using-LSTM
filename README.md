Forecasting using Time Series
Time series forecasting is a technique for predicting events through a time sequence. The technique is used in many fields of study, from geology to behaviour to economics. Techniques predict future events by analyzing trends from the past, assuming that future trends will hold similar to historical trends.

LSTM stands for Short Term Long Term Memory. It is a model or an architecture that extends the memory of recurrent neural networks. Typically, recurrent neural networks have “short-term memory” in that they use persistent past information for use in the current neural network. Essentially, the previous information is used in the current task. This means that we do not have a list of all of the previous information available for the neural node.
